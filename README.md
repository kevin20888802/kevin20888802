Fumos are a line of high-quality plush character figures manufactured and sold by the Japanese company Gift. Fumos exist for multiple franchises, but most notably the Touhou Project. Touhou Fumos are designed by ANGELTYPE. 

Fumos are generally difficult to purchase, even in Japan, due to their relative scarcity. Fumos are out-of-stock as a rule, and Gift typically only manufactures them twice a year, when they open for limited pre-orders. For most restocks, Gift does not ship outside of Japan; when they do, the sales go through the AmiAmi store.
